## Parkinson's Disease Predictor

# Overview

The Parkinson's Disease Predictor is an AI-driven tool designed to help medical professionals predict the results of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) test. By using deep learning techniques, it enables more precise and timely diagnoses, contributing to better management of Parkinson's disease.

# Features

    AI Predictions: The tool uses advanced deep learning algorithms to predict UPDRS scores.
    Multiple Models Tested: Various machine learning models were tested to determine the most accurate one.
    Enhanced Diagnostics: It aids healthcare providers in making informed decisions for better patient care.

# Models Used

We explored different machine learning models to identify the best one for predicting the progression of Parkinson's disease. After evaluating their performance, we selected the model that provided the most reliable predictions.

# How It Works

    Data Input: The model accepts patient data related to Parkinson's disease symptoms, history, and other relevant factors.
    Prediction: The deep learning model processes the data to predict UPDRS test results.
    Results: The model generates predictions that can help medical professionals with clinical decision-making.
