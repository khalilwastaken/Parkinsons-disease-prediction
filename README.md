Project-Parkinson: Parkinson's Disease Predictor
Overview

Welcome to Parkinson's Disease Predictor, an innovative AI-driven tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in predicting the results of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) test. Using advanced deep learning models, this tool enhances diagnostic precision, enabling timely and accurate assessments of Parkinsonâ€™s disease progression. Welcome to a new era in healthcare!
Key Features

    AI-Powered Predictions: Leverages cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to predict UPDRS test results.
    Optimized Machine Learning Models: Multiple machine learning models were evaluated to identify the most accurate one for predicting Parkinson's progression.
    Improved Diagnostics: Supports medical professionals in making informed decisions that contribute to better patient care and management.

Models Used

We experimented with various machine learning models to determine the most effective one for predicting Parkinson's disease progression. After assessing their performance, the best-performing model was selected to provide the most accurate and reliable predictions.
How It Works
1. Data Input

The model takes in data relevant to Parkinson's disease symptoms, patient history, and other key factors.
2. Prediction Process

The deep learning model processes the data and generates predictions for UPDRS scores, which reflect the severity of Parkinson's symptoms.
3. Results

Healthcare providers can use these predictions to guide clinical decisions, improving the comprehensive understanding of each patient's condition.
