Project-Parkinson: Parkinson's Disease Predictor
Overview

Welcome to the Parkinson's Disease Predictor, an innovative AI-driven tool designed to assist medical professionals in predicting the results of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) test. This deep learning model empowers healthcare providers with enhanced diagnostic precision, enabling timely and accurate assessments of Parkinson's disease progression. Welcome to a new era in healthcare.
Features

    AI-Powered Predictions: Our tool uses cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to predict UPDRS test results.
    Optimized Machine Learning Models: We tested several machine learning models to determine the most accurate one for predicting Parkinson's progression.
    Improved Diagnostics: This tool supports medical professionals in making better-informed decisions, contributing to improved patient care and management.

Models Used

To identify the most effective predictive model, we experimented with different machine learning approaches. After evaluating the performance of each, we selected the best-performing model to provide the most reliable and accurate predictions.
How It Works

    Data Input: The model receives data relevant to Parkinson's disease symptoms, patient history, and other key factors.
    Prediction Process: Our deep learning model processes the data and generates predictions for UPDRS scores, reflecting the severity of Parkinson's symptoms.
    Results: Medical professionals can then use these predictions to guide their clinical decisions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition.
